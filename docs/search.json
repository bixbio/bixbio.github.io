    "section": "Perspective",
    "text": "Perspective\nThe roughly 400 samples present in the Bixbio reference dataset may not seem like much compared to the scope of modern biobanks: the largest repository of genomic data in the world, for instance, is the UK Biobank, which currently consists of around 500,000 whole-genome samples; and the largest resource for aggregate genomic data, gnomAD, includes allele statistics from roughly 76,000 whole genomes. The UK Biobank is primarily made up of data from white individuals – approximately 95.6% of the dataset – alongside a small fraction of black individuals – roughly 1.6% [2,3]. (Recent UK census data reports values of 83.1% and 3.7% for these ethnic groups respectively, for comparison [4,5].) On the other hand, gnomAD’s whole-genome dataset is significantly more diverse: although 51.7% of its samples are from European ethnicities (not necessarily white), 27.2% are from African or admixed African groups [6].\nWhat does this mean in terms of sample numbers? Well, combined, two of the largest genomic datasets in the world include 28,926 (8,182 + 20,744) whole-genome samples from individuals of African descent. In addition to the fact that this is an alarmingly small number, there are three things to note here:\n\nAlmost no genomic data comes from Southern Africa – let alone South Africa. Due to the fact that very little genetic sequencing occurs on the African continent (a disparity that is unfortunately growing [7]), much of the African-ancestry data that does exist represents African American, West African, and East African subpopulations; primarily from more developed African nations such as Nigeria and Kenya. This is a crucial omission, not just because there is more genetic diversity within the African continent than there is outside of it (see again our related article), but because these datasets are used to improve both bioinformatics and medical research and methods – and research has shown that the under-representation of ethnic groups can lead to inequalities in the efficacy of such methods [8].\nAll genomic data is not created equal, because large data sets are analysed using a variety of software pipelines. The sequencing and analysis of genomic data – the ‘calling’ of variant alleles from DNA ‘reads’ – is a complex, constantly evolving science. The last few years have seen, for instance, the introduction of long-read sequencing [9], machine learning-based variant-calling algorithms [10], and non-linear reference ‘pangenomes’ [11]. While this is in general a good thing for diverse data sets, it introduces real complications, since the outputs of different pipelines – and often even versions of the same pipeline – can generally not be compared or combined directly. The UK Biobank’s whole-genome data, for example, was analysed using two different pipelines, the most recent of which was released in 2020 and has been superseded by multiple newer versions. The gnomAD dataset is far more complex, involving data from more than 300 sources, and as such its maintainers were required to develop a pipeline of their own to combine and standardise disparate data [12]. The point here is that if the goal is a statistical analysis of a large number of genomes, the analysis procedure matters arguably as much as the composition of the dataset; and it isn’t good enough for African genomic data to simply exist: it needs to be analysed correctly as well.\nNot all genomic data is equally accessible. This is perhaps perfectly understandable when one considers what whole-genome data is: a complete record of an individual’s DNA sequence. The ethical concerns surrounding the capture, access, and study of any genomic data are not trivial – especially when it comes to under-represented and previously disadvantaged people groups. The UK Biobank data contains individual whole-genome data, and researchers who apply for access to the data undergo a comprehensive vetting procedure. The gnomAD data is aggregated, i.e., each variant allele in the database is annotated with the frequency with which it occurs in certain subpopulations – but it is impossible to tell which alleles any single individual has. The gnomAD data is publicly accessible for this very reason: that genomes cannot be directly accessed.\n\nThere are two significant, diverse, publicly accessible datasets that are exceptions to some or all of the above points: the 1000 Genomes Project (1KGP [13]) and the Human Genome Diversity Project (HGDP [14]). Both of these datasets include significant numbers of samples from globally diverse ethnicities, and both are publicly accessible. The 1KGP dataset, too, is consistently reanalysed using up-to-date pipelines (by, for instance, Illumina [15]) to ensure that it remains a valuable resource for global genomic research. The 1KGP cohort consists of 2,504 samples (excluding related individuals), of which 661 are of African ancestry (including 157 African American and African Caribbean samples). The HGDP cohort consists of 828 samples, of which 88 are from Africa (6 from Southern Africa). Both of these datasets are included in and contribute to gnomAD’s statistics."

South Africa is one of the most diverse countries in the world – it is home to significant subpopulations of African, Indian, white, and coloured1 ethnicities, and has 11 official spoken languages. While Bixbio’s dataset compares favourably to both the 1KGP and HGDP cohorts in terms of both sample and ethnicity numbers, it doesn’t yet represent the full scope of genetic diversity present in South Africa. And if there remains work to be done in this regard within a single Southern African country, what does that lead us to ask about the road to a truly African (and a truly global) genomic dataset?"

    "text": "Introducing the landscape\nFor those unfamiliar with the workings of a research lab, it’s a more complex environment than it might first appear. Research laboratories are structured to support a diverse range of operations, often leading to setups that can be challenging from an efficiency standpoint – far from the streamlined structure of a factory or high-throughput facility. In this setting, precision equipment is tailored to specific tasks: pipettes, centrifuges, shakers, sequencers, and fumehoods are all essential tools, each with a distinct role in the workflow. Add to this a range of consumables like pipette tips, PCR plates, microseals, and filters, alongside carefully stored reagents that need precise handling and refrigeration, and you have an intricate web of resources to manage.\nSuccessfully analysing the human genome demands careful orchestration of these resources, starting with extracting human DNA from a sample – usually blood – and preparing it for sequencing, a process used to determine the sequence of nucleotides in DNA. Each stage involves multiple steps, both chemical and mechanical, and requires transferring samples across various stations in the lab without introducing contaminants or errors- all while working at the microliter scale. The aim is to maintain consistency and minimise variability, but this is no simple task."

    "section": "Navigating the challenges",
    "text": "Navigating the challenges\nOne of the most significant challenges in lab work is maintaining control over these components to avoid any missteps. Even minor errors can lead to skewed results and unreliable conclusions. Given the high costs associated with genome sequencing, reducing errors is imperative, as is detecting them immediately should they occur. Laboratory protocols often span several hours or even days, adding a layer of complexity as labs work to meet time-sensitive deadlines in a setting that doesn’t always prioritise efficiency.\nBalancing all these demands – precise handling, error avoidance, and timely delivery – can strain lab personnel and introduce fatigue, a common precursor to mistakes. By implementing LEAN methodologies, we’ve transformed these complexities into structured, repeatable processes that consistently produce high-quality data without overburdening lab technicians. LEAN has been instrumental in shaping our operations, fostering an environment where reliability, consistency, and quality are the norms, all while reducing the risk of technician burnout."

    "text": "The challenge we faced\nOur team encountered a unique set of challenges: we needed to process a large volume of irreplaceable samples through multiple lab protocols, from DNA extraction to sequencing, with a small team where only one member had lab experience. Compounding this were the high costs associated with sequencing and the fact that the samples were shipped internationally, which left little room for error or reruns.\nAdding to the complexity, our laboratory setup was research-oriented rather than optimised for high throughput, meaning we couldn’t simply adopt manufacturing processes. Instead, each workflow we developed had to be closely aligned with scientific requirements, following strict quality metrics in each phase of the process. These protocols were time-intensive and involved hours-long steps, further limited by the availability of sequencers. Given these constraints, our process needed to be resilient, repeatable, and scientifically robust."

    "section": "Our solution",
    "text": "Our solution\nThrough LEAN principles, we transformed our research-driven workflow into an operation resembling a high-throughput facility. This shift allowed us to process batches of samples – from DNA extraction through sequencing – at a much faster rate, increased process flow, reduced our error rate to nearly zero, and established procedures that were repeatable and easy to follow.\nApplying LEAN methodologies, we adopted practices like continuous improvement, visual management, work levelling (Heijunka), Just-in-Time, and strategies to reduce waste (Muda), overload (Muri), and inconsistency (Mura). Each concept had a specific role in streamlining our processes and rethinking problem-solving within our lab. These methods trace back to the Toyota Production System, where continuous improvements led to better flow in production and a more varied product line than what Ford had developed with flow production.\nLEAN allowed us to minimise mistakes, eliminate waste, and establish a reliable, repeatable process. Through continuous improvement (Kaizen), we identified process weaknesses and systematically refined them, enhancing both efficiency and quality.\n\nGemba1\nBefore any improvements, we immersed ourselves in the lab’s prescribed processes, observing and experiencing each protocol in detail. This hands-on approach, known in LEAN as “walking the Gemba”, involved acknowledging and learning from inevitable mistakes to understand our protocols thoroughly. Only by recognising these details were we able to make informed adjustments toward efficiency.\n\n\nImplementing 5S\nAfter familiarising ourselves with the process, we implemented improvement strategies to enhance quality and minimise errors. Given that we work with highly sensitive genetic data, accuracy is critical, and errors must be caught as early as possible. We used visual management and the 5S method – Sort, Set in Order, Shine, Standardise, and Sustain – to bring structure to the workflow and eliminate distractions.\nWe organised lab equipment and supplies systematically, ensuring that only essential items for each protocol were present. For instance, we designated specific zones on the workbench with taped outlines for necessary tools, ensuring that items like the magnet block were always in the same spot. This setup made it simple to check if any equipment was missing, saved time during protocol setup, and visually decluttered the workspace, reducing distractions and potential errors.\nThrough these initiatives, we created a structured, dependable environment that not only improved workflow but also enhanced the overall quality and consistency of our results.\n\n\nVisual management\nIn a complex lab environment, where technicians handle minuscule volumes down to microliters, keeping track of each step is challenging, especially with the potential for distraction. Technicians often use memorisation tricks to track positions on a 96-well PCR plate, but even a brief lapse can disrupt accuracy. We started by understanding the general process that is followed in each iteration of handling a sample (An illustration of the flow is below). We then, to counter any disruption, created a reliable orientation method to ensure consistency in handling the plate.\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n  A(((Start))) --&gt; B([Remove pipette tip &lt;br&gt; from position A1]) \n  B --&gt; C([Collect the &lt;br&gt; required reagent])\n  C --&gt; D([Insert reagent&lt;br&gt; into position A1])\n  D --&gt; E([Discard the&lt;br&gt; pipette tip])\n  E --&gt; F(((End)))\n\n  style A fill:#32CD32,stroke:#000000,stroke-width:2px\n  style F fill:#FF0000,stroke:#000000,stroke-width:2px\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe aligned the orientation of the pipette tip box with the reagents and the PCR plate itself, so the bottom-left corner of each (say, position A1) always corresponded across the materials. This meant that if a pipette tip was missing from a specific position, it indicated that the corresponding well on the PCR plate had already received its reagent. For example, if a technician reached position C5 in the pipette box, they would know to input reagent into position C5 on the PCR plate.\nTo simplify this even further, we designed a template for the transparent PCR plate with a visible “crosshair” indicator, marking the correct well for each step. This template served as a basic poka-yoke (error-proofing) tool, providing a visual cue to reduce mistakes and a third layer of assurance for accurate pipetting.\n\n\nEnhancing flow\nThe concept of continuous flow, borrowed from manufacturing, proved invaluable in refining our processes. Any disruption in flow indicated an opportunity for improvement. With this approach, we focused on planning each step carefully to maintain an uninterrupted sequence from start to finish.\nA major gain in efficiency came from pre-marking and organising consumables before starting each protocol. Understanding the transformations that samples undergo throughout a protocol enables us to anticipate needs and keep materials ready, minimising delays and reducing the chance of error.\nWe also noticed excessive hand movement as a source of technician fatigue and errors. To address this, we mapped out an ideal sequence of actions – selecting the pipette, attaching the tip, gathering the reagent, inputting it into the sample, and discarding the tip – and arranged the workspace within the fumehood accordingly (An diagram of the workflow is seen below). Pipettes, tips, reagents, and waste bins were all placed to facilitate a smooth, left-to-right workflow. This setup was especially beneficial in our mixed-use lab, where benches were cleared daily, making it essential to have an arrangement that could be reestablished quickly.\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\nA(((Start))) --&gt; B([Choose the &lt;br&gt;correct pipette])\nB --&gt; C([Pick up the &lt;br&gt; pipette tip])\nC --&gt; D([Collect &lt;br&gt; the reagent])\nD --&gt; E([Insert reagent &lt;br&gt; into the sample])\nE --&gt; F([Discard &lt;br&gt; pipette tip])\nF --&gt; G(((End)))\n\n  style A fill:#32CD32,stroke:#000000,stroke-width:2px\n  style G fill:#FF0000,stroke:#000000,stroke-width:2px\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe extended this flow approach beyond the fumehood, arranging the entire lab space to maintain a logical sequence, with minimal walking needed between workstations. Equipment was organised to keep necessary tools within one or two steps, reducing the risk of errors from sample handling. This layout borrowed from the concept of “work cells” in manufacturing, creating a cohesive workspace that enhanced both efficiency and accuracy across protocols."

This case illustrates how LEAN principles, though traditionally associated with manufacturing, can be transformative in a lab environment as well."

    "text": "At Bixbio we work with the most diverse genomic data, all of the time, and we believe that diversity is the most important differentiator in both genetic research and its practical applications. So one might expect that we’d be very good at explaining why we care about genetic diversity, and even more fundamentally, what genetic diversity is. But the truth is that genetic diversity isn’t just one simple concept, and this means that it’s often talked about in ways that might not make intuitive sense, using broad strokes or impressive but opaque statistics. A proper explanation requires a small amount of patience – and a decent amount of good-quality data.\nThe goal of this post is to attempt to provide such an explanation, highlighting the importance of African data along the way – the two are almost inseparable after all, given that Africa “harbours more genetic diversity” than any other continent [1]. Here we’ll try to unpack what that means.\nThis topic lies at the heart of what we do at Bixbio: developing tools to analyse diverse genomic data as accurately and powerfully as possible. Much of that work is statistical in nature (I am a mathematician/computer scientist by training), and the content of this article reflects as much. While an effort has been made to be clear and thorough when explaining biological concepts, the intention here is not to provide a complete lesson in human or population genetics – for that one should find a good textbook.\nWe start with a basic description of genetic variation and the mechanisms that give rise to genetic diversity, along with a useful illustration of global diversity from an African perspective. The remainder of the article then works towards a more complete demonstration of genetic diversity by describing how it originates at the haplotype level: we first show the difficulty of effectively describing diversity using genome-wide statistics, and then give an example of the extent of haplotype diversity within a single gene. If you already know what a haplotype block is1 you might choose to skip straight to the end, perhaps skimming the figures along the way."

So one might expect that we’d be very good at explaining why we care about genetic diversity, and even more fundamentally, what genetic diversity is. But the truth is that genetic diversity isn’t just one simple concept, and this means that it’s often talked about in ways that might not make intuitive sense, using broad strokes or impressive but opaque statistics. A proper explanation requires a small amount of patience – and a decent amount of good-quality data.\nThe goal of this post is to attempt to provide such an explanation, highlighting the importance of African data along the way – the two are almost inseparable after all, given that Africa “harbours more genetic diversity” than any other continent [1]. Here we’ll try to unpack what that means.\nThis topic lies at the heart of what we do at Bixbio: developing tools to analyse diverse genomic data as accurately and powerfully as possible. Much of that work is statistical in nature (I am a mathematician/computer scientist by training), and the content of this article reflects as much. While an effort has been made to be clear and thorough when explaining biological concepts, the intention here is not to provide a complete lesson in human or population genetics – for that one should find a good textbook.\nWe start with a basic description of genetic variation and the mechanisms that give rise to genetic diversity, along with a useful illustration of global diversity from an African perspective. The remainder of the article then works towards a more complete demonstration of genetic diversity by describing how it originates at the haplotype level: we first show the difficulty of effectively describing diversity using genome-wide statistics, and then give an example of the extent of haplotype diversity within a single gene. If you already know what a haplotype block is1 you might choose to skip straight to the end, perhaps skimming the figures along the way."

    "section": "The basics",
    "text": "The basics\nStarting at the beginning: each of us inherits 23 chromosomes from each of our parents, giving us 23 pairs of chromosomes, one of which is a pair of sex chromosomes – XX or XY. The genome refers to an individual’s complete set of DNA, made up of their chromosomes and a small amount of mitochondrial DNA inherited from their mother. DNA is made up of four nucleotides (represented by As, Cs, Gs, and Ts), and the ‘length’ of the human genome measured in nucleotides is around 6.2 billion base-pairs (bp) – about 3.1 billion bp per set of chromosomes.\nIf you consider any two individuals, the vast majority of their genomes will be the same – they’ll have about 99.9% of their DNA in common. But this doesn’t mean that 99.9% of the human genome is fixed, or common to everyone. Rather, there are millions of positions along the genome where variation can occur, and this variation can take different forms: it could involve a change to a single nucleotide (so-called single-nucleotide variants, or SNVs); sequences in which a few nucleotides are ‘inserted’ or ‘deleted’ relative to one another (indels); or large-scale differences in the DNA sequence (structural variants, commonly defined as involving more than 50 bp). Generally, about 80% of the differences between two genomes are SNVs.\nRegardless of length, the known possibilities at any given position are referred to as alleles. Most variant positions will only have two possible alleles, and one allele (the ‘major’ allele) will often be far more common than the others. For the sake of illustration, a hypothetical pair of sequences involving a single-nucleotide variant might look something like the following: AATTT and ACTTT. In this case the variant’s alleles are A and C. Sequences implying an indel might be GTGTGT and GTGTGTGT, in which case the alleles could be defined as T and TGT.\nSince each of us has two ‘copies’ of each non-sex chromosome, we also have two alleles at each position where variation is known to occur. Once DNA has been sequenced (hardware) and analysed (software), we end up with what are known as variant calls: records that give the likelihood of a genome containing a variant allele on one or both strands of DNA – known as heterozygosity and homozygosity respectively. One of the difficulties when using short-read DNA sequencing (the most common technology) is that it is in general not possible to ‘phase’ alleles across positions, separating alleles of the maternal chromosome from those of the paternal one, and thereby reconstructing the individual chromosomes.2 This is not a critical issue, since a lot of genomic analysis occurs at the single-variant level, but it will be important in understanding later sections of this article. It explains too why so many statistics in genomics are currently expressed in terms of simple variant counts, even though variants are not the most natural way to think about genetic diversity; and doing so can, at times (or without proper context), be somewhat confusing.\n\nPopulation groups\nGiven two individual genomes then, the ‘99.9% similar’ statistic stated above comes from the fact that the first will differ from the second by about 5–7 million alleles. We say 5 to 7 million because it depends very much on who the two individuals are. And this is where things get interesting.\nThe 1000 Genomes Project [3], or 1KGP, is one of the most important datasets in genomics. And like all other genomic datasets, databases, and biobanks, it stratifies its data at multiple levels. The most important of these is ethnicity, i.e., ethno-linguistic groups such as Han Chinese, Gujarati Indian, Toscani Italian, etc. The 1KGP dataset is an incredible achievement and resource, but when viewed at this level it is clear that it represents only a small slice of global genetics: its 26 ethnicities from 21 countries account for just a fraction of all of human diversity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The approximate geographical locations at which the 1KGP and Bixbio samples used in this article were collected. The 2,504 1KGP samples are in orange, and the 312 Bixbio samples in blue.\n\n\n\n\nThe 1KGP data is often grouped at higher levels as well, for instance into five continental regions: Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, Eastern Asia, Southern Asia, and Europe. The difficulty with such groupings is immediately apparent: what about Northern Africa, the Middle East, etc.? Which parts of Europe are represented? (Britain, Finland, Spain, and Italy.) Does Sub-Saharan Africa include Southern Africa? (No.)\nAnd more importantly, does it even make sense to talk about different ‘groups’ of humans? The answer to this is both yes and no: yes, because if two groups of people don’t cross paths for long periods of time their genetics will reflect this – we will be able to predict which group an individual belongs to by looking at inherited patterns in their genome. And no, because human genetics exists as a spectrum [4]. The fact that it often looks as though it can be partitioned into neat categories is due to the difficulty of collecting genomic data – of course sampled individuals from Western Africa and Eastern Asia will have noticeably different ancestry. But for every two seemingly distinguishable groups of people, we’ll almost certainly be able to find a group that lies in between and bridges the genetic gap. This is not to say that there is a problem with the 1KGP or any other dataset, but simply a reminder that those of us who make use of such datasets have a responsibility to represent them with fidelity.\nDisclaimer aside, the truth is that continental groupings are useful for genetic analyses, since they are naturally intertwined with the migrations of ancient human populations, and therefore with human evolution and genetic diversity. In what ways do we see this? Well for one (returning to the example above): the genomes of two individuals sampled from Europe, Asia, or the Americas will differ by roughly 5 million alleles across perhaps 4.5 million variant positions. This is the case if the individuals are of the same ethnicity (but not close relatives), or if they come from opposite ends of the world. If one (or both) of those individuals were from Africa, however, the difference would be significantly greater: around 6.5 million alleles across 5.5 million positions. Two individuals from, say, a Zulu population in South Africa will have at least 6 million allelic differences – as will a Zulu and Luhya (Kenyan) pair, and a Zulu and Dai (Chinese) pair, and a Luhya and Toscani (Italian) pair. If neither individual is of African ancestry, however, there will be about 20% less genetic variation: between two Toscani individuals, say, or Toscani and Finnish, Finnish and Gujarati (Indian), etc.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: The number of variant alleles and variant sites, respectively, at which two genomes differ (technically autosomes, since sex chromosomes were ignored), grouped by whether both, one, or neither of the individuals are African. Pairwise comparisons for 62 samples are shown (two samples per ethnic group; 1,891 data points).\n\n\n\nThe bottom line is that in general, two people from anywhere outside of Africa are more genetically similar to each other than two people from within Africa. And furthermore, diversity on the African continent can be seen as the norm, since the level of similarity between two African individuals and between an African and a non-African is roughly the same. At Bixbio we sometimes express this remarkable fact by saying that from an African perspective, everyone is African.\n\n\nMutation and recombination\nHow is it that genomes differ in the first place, and to such varying extents? We’ll continue to explore this in the following sections, but the brief answer is that there are two mechanisms at work: random mutation, which introduces new alleles into a DNA sequence, and recombination, which mixes existing chromosomes to create new, hybrid ones. Mutations are the ultimate source of new genetic variation (and diversity), but the way in which they are propagated throughout a population is due to recombination.\nConsider again the fact that you have two copies of each chromosome, but that your child only inherits one from you – which one do they get? The marvellous reality is that chromosomes are inherited in a ‘patchwork’ manner: the chromosome 1 that you pass on to your child,4 for example, is created when your two copies of that chromosome come together and exchange stretches of DNA during recombination, as part of a process called meiosis. So each stretch of the chromosome you received from your father matches one of his two copies of that chromosome: one such segment may match the one from his father, while a stretch of DNA further along the same chromosome might match the one from his mother. This means that although your DNA is for all intents and purposes half from your mother and half from your father, it is not necessarily a quarter from each of your grandparents.\nBoth mutation and recombination occur randomly, but recombination is more likely to occur at certain ‘hotspots’ throughout the genome [5]. Together the two mechanisms ensure that the DNA of every sperm or egg cell is essentially unique. The former might take place on the order of 100 times across the genome, and the latter perhaps once or twice per chromosome [6].\nOver thousands of generations, the ancestral tree of any population group will become incredibly complex,5 but certain ancestries (and ancestors) will come to dominate the group’s genetics at certain times. Two seemingly contradictory characteristics will arise: on the one hand, the genome of any given individual will contain DNA from essentially all of these ancestries, since they will have mingled and recombined over time. But on the other hand, at the smaller scale – where the DNA has mostly been spared the shuffling effect of recombination – the ancestral genomes will still be intact and distinguishable, along with the mutations that accumulated and differentiated them in the first place.\nOn the far more comprehensible time scale of our own lifetimes, this means that although none of us shares a complete genome with anyone else (apart from identical twins), we all share many small segments of DNA with people all over the world – and the set of people we have DNA in common with differs per segment. We are, each one of us, a human mosaic. Because of recombination, the genetic history of a population is imprinted on the genomes of all of its members, not siloed into distinct subgroups. This remarkable fact, you might have realised, means that each of us carries a trace of the history of the human race in our DNA. We just won’t be able to make sense of it without comparing it to the DNA of others.\nThe DNA segments mentioned above – the ones shared by many people across a population, or across the world if they are old enough – are the building blocks of genetic diversity. Accordingly, they are called haplotype blocks, or haploblocks for short. Stated another way, a haplotype block is “a region of the genome with a shared pattern of ancestry” [2]. The simple fact is, as we will see below, that non-African populations have significantly fewer distinct haploblocks than African populations, consistent with the consensus that all of these populations at some point migrated out of Africa, and by doing so underwent evolutionary ‘bottleneck’ events."

    "section": "The statistics",
    "text": "The statistics\nRewinding slightly before we look at examples of haploblock variation, it’s worth reiterating that the majority of computational genetics currently doesn’t deal with haplotypes.6 Plenty of analysis is done at the individual variant level due to the mechanical, statistical, and computational difficulty of inferring and working with haplotypes. This leads us back to our statistics: how else do the variants in a dataset reflect the underlying diversity?\nOne of the most commonly presented statistics used to describe diversity is the number of distinct alleles observed (or ‘discovered’) in a sample population. Variant alleles that have never been seen before are termed novel, and are generally used to support the uniqueness or importance of new genomic data. More interesting than alleles that are only found in certain datasets, from our perspective, are those that are found in specific subpopulations. For instance, considering just the 1KGP dataset so as not to inflate the number of African samples, we might report the following statistics based on its 2,504 whole-genome samples:\n\nThe total number of (distinct) alleles observed in the dataset: about 272 million alleles across 136 million variant sites (including reference – GRCh38 – alleles). This is influenced by both the size and diversity of the dataset.\nThe fraction of the total allele set found in specific subsets of the data – for instance based on continental regions. If only the 661 African samples had been sequenced, 49% of the distinct non-reference alleles would have been observed, compared to 29% if only the 503 European samples had been collected. There were 66 million such alleles present in the African subset, compared to 39 million in the European, and 102 million in the combined non-African subset of the data (1,843 samples).\nThe number of alleles that are unique to subsets of the data: there are 33 million alleles that are only observed in the African subset of the data, for example, compared to 18 million alleles unique to Southern Asia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Allele-count statistics for geographical subsets of the 1KGP dataset. The panels show, respectively: the number of samples from each region, the total number of non-reference alleles observed in each sample set, and the number of non-reference alleles that are observed only in a given sample set. There are more ‘African’ samples than those from other regions because we have included African American and African Caribbean individuals in this category (Figure 4 will make it clear why). Note also that the rate of variant discovery slows as the number of samples increases, so the outsized number of African alleles is due more to the region’s diversity than to the number of samples.\n\n\n\nOne can of course go further than this as well: it’s sometimes useful to see the rate at which distinct variants are discovered in a certain dataset, for instance by plotting the number of alleles observed in a sample of 10 individuals, then 50, 100, etc. One would see that genomic data from African ancestries yields more alleles with fewer samples – i.e., at a faster rate. It’s worth noting here though that the majority of genetic (minor) alleles are rare; that is, they only occur in a very small proportion of a population. This means that the rate at which new alleles are discovered decreases as more samples are sequenced.\nThese variant/allele statistics make it perfectly clear that African genetics is significantly more diverse than that of any other continent. And for practising researchers these numbers are the important ones – they directly quantify diversity based on the data we get from sequenced DNA. But consider them in isolation: do they make intuitive sense? Do they lead to more questions? For instance, are variant alleles randomly occurring in Africa at a greater rate than elsewhere? (No.) Why are there significant numbers of alleles that are unique to any region, not just Africa? (The accumulation of random mutations through either chance or selection.)\nAnd then reflect back on the pairwise statistic we introduced earlier: how can it be possible for subpopulations to have so many unique genetic variants, and at the same time for the number of differences between two individuals from that group, or from two groups on different sides of the world, to be roughly the same?"

    "section": "The simple explanation",
    "text": "The simple explanation\nThis explanation has of course been anything but simple so far, but as with most science7 its individual pieces are relatively easy to grasp, and understanding the concept as a whole mostly involves placing the pieces in logical order. So let’s recap:\n\nOur genomes are made up of 23 pairs of chromosomes (plus some mitochondrial DNA).\nEach individual chromosome is inherited from one of your parents, and is a unique (re)combination of your grandparents’ chromosomes along with a small amount of random variation.\nOver many generations, ancestral genomes will spread throughout the population as small segments, meaning that your DNA is made up of stretches that are shared with many other people. These stretches of DNA are haplotype blocks, and they can theoretically be used to give a high-level description of all of the possible genomes in the population.\nHaplotype blocks are also the vehicles of genetic diversity: they represent the different forms that a certain region of DNA can take, and the number of possible haplotypes is directly coupled with the level of diversity in a population.\n\nHow does this explain the difference between African and non-African genetics at the statistical level? As a group of people separates from a population, it takes with it only those haplotypes present in the group, and any new variation added to the two groups’ genetic pools is no longer shared between them. Note also that recombinations between similar haplotypes don’t serve to deepen diversity in the way that diverse recombinations do. This is the case with populations outside of Africa: they have fewer distinct haplotypes, and a relatively small amount of variation of their own. (The theorised out-of-Africa migrations [7] didn’t take place that long ago on the anthropological timescale after all.) These populations all exhibit a similar subset of the haplotype variation still present in Africa, and as such they are less genetically diverse than African populations. This essentially answers the two main questions posed above, namely:\n\nWhy do genome comparisons involving African individuals yield more allelic differences? One can imagine comparing small blocks of the genomes separately: if either of the genomes come from a population with significantly more possible haplotypes (as is the case in Africa), there is a smaller chance of the haplotypes (and alleles) matching.\nWhy do non-African populations appear similar in spite of their unique variants? Population-specific variants do differentiate global populations, but their effect is slight when compared to the differences due to ancient haplotype diversity. On an evolutionary timescale, we (human beings) have spent far more time acquiring shared variation in Africa than we have acquiring unique variation outside of Africa."

    "section": "The example",
    "text": "The example\nThe goal of this article (if you recall) was to demonstrate the difference in genetic diversity inside and outside of Africa, and as we just mentioned above, haplotype blocks are well suited to doing so. So consider a certain section of the human genome: the gene CYP2D6. This gene refers to a region of about 6,000 bp on chromosome 22, roughly 80% of the way along its 50-million bp length. The CYP2D6 gene is of particular interest in genomics because the enzyme it encodes is involved in the metabolism of about 25% of commonly prescribed drugs [8]. For the sake of this article it is of no special interest – we could have chosen any region of the genome – but it is worth mentioning that protein-coding regions such as these are thought to be less diverse than the remainder (and majority) of the genome.\nThe following visualisations are based on the combined 1KGP/Bixbio dataset of 2,816 individuals. From this data there are 377 observed positions along CYP2D6 where variation occurs, and 377 alleles in total. Of the non-major alleles at these sites, most are infrequent: only 44 occur in more than 1% of the dataset. By clustering the variant call patterns of individual samples, we see a few common genotypes: that is, variant calls for both chromosomes for each individual. With a further round of analysis we can then recover the individual haplotypes in each genotype by noting that the alleles observed in each genotype are the union of the two underlying haplotypes’ alleles, and that the true set of haplotypes must ‘sum’ to the genotypes. It’s important to note that, like all statistical inference, this is an approximate process – although in this case the data is relatively easy to make sense of.\nIn the end this approach identifies a total of 12 haplotypes in the 5,632 genomes in the data set, across 30 ethnicities. Each haplotype is defined by 6 alleles on average. This of course does not mean that all of the individuals treated as possessing a given copy of CYP2D6 have exactly the same sequence of that gene – the clustering process likely ignores spurious differences such as sequencing errors or very recent mutation – but it is immediately apparent which ancestral ‘version’ of CYP2D6 each individual has.\nFigure 4 shows the fraction of each ethnicity’s samples with a given haplotype (so each row sums to 1). This figure summarises many of the points we’ve made in this article, and hopefully now does so in a more intuitive way than the statistics of previous sections. We see, as expected, that significantly more haplotypes – i.e., versions of the gene – exist in African subpopulations than anywhere else, and that non-African variation is by and large a subset of African variation. The non-African subpopulations share strikingly similar sets of haplotypes, with some divergence in Eastern Asian ethnicities. Compare this figure to Figure 3: it should now be clear why Africa has more distinct alleles in total, as well as many alleles not found in any other region (presumably from haplotypes unique to Africa).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Haplotype frequency by ethnicity. Each column represents a CYP2D6 haplotype inferred from the dataset, and each cell in the heatmap shows the fraction of an ethnicity’s samples that have a copy of that haplotype. The values in each row sum to 1.\n\n\n\nThe genotypes present in the dataset can be visualised in the same way, demonstrating how haplotypes might be paired together in different subpopulations. These genotype clusters essentially describe all of the possible versions of CYP2D6 that an individual might have (based on the small sample of healthy individuals in the dataset). We see 25 such genotypes,8 showing similar patterns to that of the previous figure but slightly obscuring the fact that many genotypes overlap due to shared haplotypes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Genotype frequency by ethnicity. Each column in the figure corresponds to a pair of haplotypes from Figure 4 as observed in genomes in the dataset. Cells once again represent the fraction of an ethnicity’s samples with a given genotype."

    "title": "Haplotype Diversity in Africa",
    "section": "The point",
    "text": "The point\nThere are essentially three main points here:\n\nFirstly, that we all share a common human ancestry, as told by our DNA. Each of our genomes is a unique combination of haplotypes, but these haplotypes do not ‘belong’ to us – they are shared with many others in the population. Human genetics is dense, complex, and exists as a spectrum, but at the small scale it can still be understood and represented relatively easily.\nSecondly, Africa is home to significantly more genetic diversity than anywhere else in the world, and the genetic diversity found elsewhere is essentially a subset of Africa’s. One way to make sense of this is simply to understand that for any region in the genome, the number of distinct haplotypes found in Africa is greater than the number found anywhere else; as ancient people groups migrated out of Africa, they took with them only a subset of African haplotype diversity.\nAnd thirdly, diversity matters. To understand global genomics, we need to understand genetic diversity, and to understand diversity we need to understand African genetics.\n\nThis third point is one that we haven’t touched on directly yet, but as a company it forms the core of our vision. Genomic medicine is already relatively commonplace in developed countries, and it will only become more so – in all likelihood quite rapidly. Its applications are varied: a genome might be sequenced in an effort to screen for certain diseases, to diagnose certain genetic conditions, or to predict the risk of a specific individual developing a disease [9]. On the treatment side, the field of pharmacogenomics studies the impact that genetics has on the safety and efficacy of drugs, and involves tailoring treatment plans to an individual based on their DNA – for instance by predicting which drugs will work best. Gene therapy goes even further, by inserting healthy versions of a gene into a patient’s cells [10].\nAll of this work relies on sophisticated biological and statistical analyses, since one needs to find associations between genomic features and disease mechanisms. Because of this, modern drug development is now highly dependent on such data. The catch, however – and the reason that articles such as this one, and companies such as Bixbio, are necessary – is that global populations are not equally represented when it comes to such research. Far from it. The most common form of analyses used to look for genetic markers correlated with disease – genome-wide association studies (GWAS) – are heavily skewed towards European data: at the time of writing only 0.2% of all GWAS participant data is estimated to be of African ancestry [GWAS Diversity Monitor, 11]. This means that predictions and treatments don’t necessarily work as well (or at the very least aren’t as well understood) in non-European populations. In light of the examples above, what comes to mind when you hear this? Does it seem… sensible? How much knowledge, and how many advancements, are we missing out on?\nThere are, thankfully, promising efforts to address this imbalance: many public genomic datasets place a high priority on collecting samples from under-represented population groups; graph reference genomes have arisen as a means of reducing the bias introduced by current, linear reference genomes; and valuable research is being done to support the effective presentation and analysis of multi-ancestry genomic data. (See for instance the HPRC, or gnomAD). But the problem does still remain – and at least in the case of GWAS is only getting worse – due to the fact that almost all DNA sequencing takes place in developed countries.\nOur hope, and goal, is that current efforts to diversify genomic research will gain traction and be able to transform the field, since if one thing is clear it’s that those working in it desire a society in which all individuals have access to genomic medicine of the same quality. And something that should hopefully also be clear by now is that human genetics is a fascinating, inspiring field to work in: our genetic history is simultaneously incredibly diverse and surprisingly transparent. Perhaps if it was more widely understood all genetic research would start where that shared history does: here in Africa."
